## Project Summary

This project designs an end-to-end data pipeline to prepare, transform, and model clinical healthcare data for predicting the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The focus is on data reliability, preprocessing at scale, and model-ready datasets, rather than only model accuracy.
The system demonstrates how raw healthcare data can be transformed into clean, validated, and feature-engineered datasets suitable for downstream machine learning and analytics use cases.

## Business / Clinical Objective

- Predict the likelihood of gestational diabetes during pregnancy

- Support early intervention and preventive care

- Improve decision-making for healthcare providers
---
## Dataset Description

The dataset (patients.csv) contains clinical and demographic information for women aged 21 years and older.

## FEATURES:

**Pregnancies** – Number of times pregnant

**Glucose** – Plasma glucose concentration (2-hour OGTT)

**BloodPressure** – Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

**SkinThickness** – Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

**Insulin** – 2-hour serum insulin (μU/ml)

**BMI** – Body mass index (kg/m²)

**Pedigree** – Diabetes pedigree function (family history)

**Age** – Age in years

## Target Variable

**Diagnosis** – Gestational diabetes diagnosis

1 = Yes

0 = No
