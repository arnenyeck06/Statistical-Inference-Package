### Gestational Diabetes Risk Prediction

## Project Summary

This project designs an end-to-end data pipeline to prepare, transform, and model clinical healthcare data for predicting the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The focus is on data reliability, preprocessing at scale, and model-ready datasets, rather than only model accuracy.

The system demonstrates how raw healthcare data can be transformed into clean, validated, and feature-engineered datasets suitable for downstream machine learning and analytics use cases.
