  The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify pregnant women who are at greater risk of developing gestational diabetes. This model will enable your hospital to provide timely clinical interventions, enhance patient outcomes, and reduce the cost of care associated with complications from gestational diabetes.

  We are provided with a dataset (patients.csv) containing information on women aged 21 years and older, including several health and demographic variables collected during pregnancy. The dataset includes the following variables:
• Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

• Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test

• BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

• SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

• Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

• BMI: Body mass index (BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2)

• Pedigree: Diabetes pedigree function (predisposition for diabetes based on family history)

• Age: Age (years)

• Diagnosis: Gestational diabetes diagnosis (1 = Yes, 0 = No) – Response/dependent variable.


  We will build a binary classification model to predict the risk of gestational diabetes using this dataset. We will proceed following these steps: Literature Review on Gestational Diabetes Prediction,
Data Exploration and Preparation, Feature Selection and Data Processing, Model Building and Validation, Analysis, Limitations, and Reporting.

# I - Data Exploration and Preprocessing.
# II- Random Forest
# III- Logistic Regression
# IV- SVM
# V- XGboost
